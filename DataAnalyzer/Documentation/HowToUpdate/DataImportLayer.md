# Data Import

## Overview

See the How To Use section for this page to understand how the application works.

## Scrapers

Scrapers are configurable actors that will take some imported data and scrape through the data to pull out the necessary pieces that are desirable to load into a concrete type within the application.

There is a separate project, `DataScraper`, that handles storing and executing the scraping process. It also contains the DTOs that are created as a result of the data scraping.

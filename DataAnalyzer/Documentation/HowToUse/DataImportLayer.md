# Data Import

## Overview

See the How To Update section for this page to understand how to make changes to this part of the application.

## Root Directory Selection

TODO --> this page needs re-organized because the browse directory is not necessary for all import types


## Conversion Controls

As the application grows, more potential data import types will be added. For every type of import, an item will appear in the combo box. Some types have sub types, in which case a second combo box will appear to select the specific sub type.
